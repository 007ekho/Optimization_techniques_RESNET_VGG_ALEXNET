# Optimization_techniques_RESNET_VGG_ALEXNET
In this study, we investigate the effects of various optimization techniques on three popular deep learning architectures: ResNet, VGG, and AlexNet. The goal is to explore how different optimization methods influence the convergence speed, generalization capability, and overall performance of these models
